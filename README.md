# neurotype
Interactive generative AI webapp that creates animated rs-fMRI brain visuals based on user traits (age, sex, personality). Pretrained a CLIP-style multimodal transformer to align neuroimaging and psychometric profiles into a shared latent space. Used DiT-based diffusion models to synthesize and animate neuroimaging data from latent controls.
