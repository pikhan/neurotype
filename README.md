# neurotype
Interactive generative AI webapp that creates animated rs-fMRI brain visuals based on user traits (age, sex, personality). Pretrained a CLIP-style multimodal transformer to align neuroimaging and psychometric profiles into a shared latent space. Used DiT-based diffusion models to synthesize and animate neuroimaging data from latent controls.

Notes:
- Estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) (mm3), Atlas scaling factor (ASF), Normalized whole brain volume (nWBV)
- Education (Educ), socioeconomic status (SES) (Rubin et al.,1998).
- Education codes correspond to the following levels of education: 1: less than high school grad., 2: high school grad., 3: some college, 4: college grad., 5: beyond college.
- Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Rubin et al., 1998)
- Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR; 0=nondemented; 0.5 â€“ very mild dementia; 1 = mild dementia; 2 = moderate dementia) (Morris, 1993). All participants with dementia (CDR >0) were diagnosed with probable AD
